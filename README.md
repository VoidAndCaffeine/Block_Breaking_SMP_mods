<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

It is kinda important that you use my configs, I have changed a few from their default settings to give yall a better out of the box experence (one of the mods had a donation request popup on the main menu that I dissabled)

If you run into any problem please open an issue, it is the best way to keep me organized and so that other people can see your problem and learn from it if they are having the same problem.
